# Fondant: Ganache-like testing environment for Casper blockchain.


## Description
As we are developing Casper blockchain apps, recently FriendlySoccer.io, we've noticed the need for an integrated testing environment. We need the Ganache equivalent in Casper Ecosystem: Quickly fire up a personal Casper network on your machine. You can run tests, explore blocks, and inspect the state while controlling how the chain operates. Everything is wrapped up in a clean and intuitive UI.
